                            various industries and sectors. </p>

                        <h2 class="lg:text-2xl md:text-2xl sm:text-xl font-bold text-web-ascent-1">Evolution of AI </h2>

                        <p class="py-2">AI has a rich history dating back to the 1950s, when the term was first coined.
                            Initially limited to government and defense applications, AI gradually expanded its reach into
                            businesses and everyday life. The development of AI technologies such as Machine Learning,
                            Neural Networks, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing has revolutionized how machines
                            interact with data and make decisions. While it is true that AI has evolved significantly over
                            the years, it is important to acknowledge that the concept of artificial intelligence has always
                            been present in various forms throughout history, even before the 1950s. One could argue that
                            the concept of artificial intelligence has been present in ancient myths and folklore, such as
                            the idea of automatons and golems. These ancient stories and beliefs about artificial beings
                            with human-like qualities demonstrate that the idea of creating intelligent machines has
                            fascinated humans for centuries. In a way, our modern advancements in AI can be seen as a
                            continuation of this age-old desire to mimic and even surpass human intelligence. As we continue
                            to push the boundaries of what machines can do, it is important to remember the rich history of
                            artificial intelligence and the diverse cultural influences that have shaped our understanding
                            of it. </p>

                        <p class="py-2">The worldwide market for image recognition is projected to reach $81.88 billion by
                            2026, reflecting the rising popularity of image recognition technology. Image recognition
                            technology has many applications in many different sectors, including healthcare, retail, and
                            security. This shows how Narrow AI can help businesses gain valuable insights and drive growth.
                        </p>

                        <p class="py-2">Additionally, Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems have been getting a lot of
                            attention as of late, with the worldwide NLP market projected to reach $29.19 billion by 2024's
                            close. Chatbots, virtual assistants, and social media monitoring are just a few examples of the
                            many uses for natural language processing (NLP) technology, which demonstrates how Narrow AI can
                            deliver precise and efficient services. </p>

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-black py-2 lg:text-xl md:text-xl sm:text-lg">General AI (Strong AI)
                        </h3>

                        <p class="py-2">General AI, also known as Strong AI, possesses human-like intelligence and is
                            capable of executing multiple tasks simultaneously. This type of AI aims to replicate human
                            intelligence across various domains, showcasing adaptability and versatility beyond specific
